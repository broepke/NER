However, I notice that even when the original Revit files are saved with the French version of the software (namely, Revit FRA), the properties (e.g. ) are exported in English ( ), and I see no option in the Model Derivative API to force using the native language. Does someone have an idea on how to do that (if it is feasible)? I have searched on the official documentation and tried modifying the parameters mentioned for the conversion (see ), but with no success so far. Of course the same issue can be of interest for those exporting to other formats than IFC, or other languages than French. Thanks!\"\n",
