In this example, I avoided modifying the model using my app but it could just be the case that the app needs to modify the model. Let me give a hypothetical use case. An architect wants to optimize performance of a design solution. S/he is constantly working on different parts of the model and committing some (most likely minor) changes to the model. Changes are sent to a central BIM 360 server or any other central Revit Server. My app will retrieve modification information from the server and evaluate the performance of the model and give feedback to the architect in a webpage. My app uses Python (sklearn, Tensorflow, etc) running on linux to process the BIM model, so independance from Revit environment and Windows is crucial. To display information to the user, it uses Web technology (e.g d3.js visualization library). provides . All of this (querying and writing BIM) is possible on IFC, however, every conversion means more complexity, data loss (IFC and RVT are not 100% compatible), computation and time. is a simpler form (file format) of this question.

Then we poll for changes to update the coloring (Firstly: pending object gets colored when the viewer loads, and then we keep polling to check and change state again, to make Forge render those in a different color and store their old color/material. When the polling received a change that an object should no longer be colored, it tells Forge to use the old color/material again. The problem: We've found out what the problem is, but we couldn't find out how to fix it.  The problem is that changing materials in Forge doesn't work after startup anymore, it only works in the first ~3 seconds or so (the materials were used to show the colors). However, setting overlays works even after the first ~3 seconds, (showing overlays instead of materials to show the colors). 
This is not what we want to achieve. This looks unoptimized, because overlays will be shown through everything. The materials, however, seem to be 'locked', as in, they cannot be changed anymore after the first ~3 seconds. It seems like they aren't refreshed or something In the examples, we found they used viewer.impl.invalidate(true) to refresh the Forge viewer, but that doesn't do anything after ~3 seconds. We've also tried every combination of viewer.impl.invalidate(true, true, true) as well as setting material.needsUpdate to true, as well as trying to re-render the entire scene. We also found this: , but we couldn't find a good way to do that in Forge, we tried viewer.requestSilentRender() but that didn't do anything either. Anyway, we've tried everything we could come up with and could find online to make the materials work, but nothing made a difference. 
We are looking to find someone that's more experienced with how Forge works that can see what the material code is doing wrong.

When we first started using it, version 3 of the unity package was available on the official website linked above. Everything worked fine, it was just very slow to import a scene into unity (10-15 min for a single family home). When visiting the Autodesk Forge DevCon in Darmstadt, October '18, we were told that the server is the bottleneck for importing a scene and that a new server will be provided until November '18. The new server should increase the performance up to 15 times. 
Similar information can be found on the , where Cyrille Fauvel (Lead Developer) states the following: '' Our preliminary test shows that the Unity plug-in load time is as
fast as the Forge WEBGL viewer or faster. '' '' Right now, the new server is on . If you want to use it, please update your code accordingly. For the Unity plugin, you need to update the URL references into the ForgeLoaderConstants.cs #19 #20. '' The problem is, that the there exist multiple different versions of the servers with different base-url's that host the AR/VR Toolkit: developer-api.autodesk.io (used as base url in unitypackage v3) developer-api-beta.autodesk.io (used as base url in unitypackage v6) developer-api-dev.autodesk.io (used as base url in a sample project that should access the new v2 server ) As mentioned in the forums and stated above, the developer-api-beta.autodesk.io server should work but does not seem to work for us. We tried the following steps to make it work: Create a new Bucket (we are EU based but tried everything with EMEA as well as US buckets) Upload revit-file to bucket (Forge BaseUrl: developer.api.autodesk.com) Translate to svf (Forge Base-Url: developer.api.autodesk.com) Create Scene Definition (AR/VR Toolkit Base-Url) Create Scene Job (AR/VR Toolkit Base-Url) Unitypackage v6 using the AR/VR Toolkit Base-Url that we also used for creating scene job, together with UnityVersion (2018.2.19f1), loading on runtime as well as loading into the editor as asset. Results (for the different AR/VR Base-Url's we tried): For developer-api-beta.autodesk.io , the import worked for a very small scene, 3 walls and a chair. However, when we tried the same with a sample house, the import was as slow as ever and did no complete as we got a lot of 404 errors as well as one 504 error in the beginning. We tried the steps above with developer-api-dev.autodesk.io , but couldn't get past step 5, as we couldn't get a manifest for the created scene job (creation worked). The exact same error (for the -beta url however) was reported by a user on November 23. on the chat (bottom right) available . We also tried unitypackage v6 together with developer-api.autodesk.io . The import didn't complete and ended with a lot of errors (404). It seemed like the loading of meshes and materials failed. We could see the scene tree in unity as well as the properties of the nodes, but no geometry. On a legacy application, we are still using the unitypackage v3 of the importer together with that specific base-url ( developer-api.autodesk.io ) and it's working slow but stable and without errors. We really tried a lot of other things for over a month but couldn't see the improved server performance.
Is there anyone that could possibly tell us if we are doing something wrong, or someone that can confirm that the server v2 (the faster one) is working for them?
Was the ""new"" server only available for a certain amount of time? Also, it is very hard to keep track of all the changes happening to the AR/VR Toolkit, as one has to gather all the information from different sources such as official site, the Autodesk Beta Forums or the wallabyway Github. Another thing that is confusing is that a lot of the times in the beta forums, the new v2 server and the v1/v2 API are mentioned together, and it is not really clear on which URL they are published eventually.Also, on the , where the documentation can be found, v2 API is marked as unpublished.",41,4961,autodesk arvr toolkit server   problem,since week problem use autodesk first start use version   unity package available official website link everything work fine slow import scene unity   min single family home visit autodesk forge devcon darmstadt october   tell server bottleneck import scene new server provide november   new server increase performance   time similar information find cyrille fauvel lead developer state follow preliminary test show unity plugin load time asfast forge webgl viewer fast right new server want use please update code accordingly unity plugin need update url reference forgeloaderconstantscs    problem exist multiple different version server different baseurl host arvr toolkit developerapiautodeskio use base url unitypackage   developerapibetaautodeskio use base url unitypackage   developerapidevautodeskio use base url sample project access new   server mention forum state developerapibetaautodeskio server work seem work we try follow step make work create new bucket eu based try everything emea well us bucket upload revitfile bucket forge baseurl developerapiautodeskcom translate svf forge baseurl developerapiautodeskcom create scene definition arvr toolkit baseurl create scene job arvr toolkit baseurl unitypackage   use arvr toolkit baseurl also use create scene job together unityversion   loading runtime well loading editor asset result different arvr baseurl try developerapibetaautodeskio import work small scene   wall chair however try sample house import slow ever complete get lot   error well one   error beginning try step developerapidevautodeskio could not get past step   could not get manifest create scene job creation work exact error beta url however report user november   chat bottom right available also try unitypackage   together developerapiautodeskio import do nt complete ended lot error   seem like load mesh material fail could see scene tree unity well property nod geometry legacy application still use unitypackage   importer together specific baseurl developerapiautodeskio work slow stable without error really try lot thing month could not see improved server performanceis anyone could possibly tell we something wrong someone confirm server   fast one work themwa new server available certain amount time also hard keep track change happen arvr toolkit one gather information different source official site autodesk beta forum wallabyway github another thing confuse lot time beta forum new   server   api mention together really clear url publish eventuallyalso documentation find   api mark unpublished

Long story short, it's very ineffective. Since filters are applied after pagination (why?) one has to iterate over all pages in the resultset in order to find all subfolders in a given folder. This can take very long time and usually requires many of roundtrips to the server when querying folders with many items in them.

Our justification for iframe instead of pop-up ( ) or redirecting current window ( ) is following: Redirecting current app window to authorization would disrupt the app workflow. Authorisation on app start is not an option. Viewer could be required at any point in existing workflow or not at all and authorisation should be triggered only just before the Viewer is required. Opening the authorisation in new window (pop-up) is disabled by default in many (desktop) browsers. Requiring the user to enable pop-ups is an option though definitely not user-friendly. Furthermore, multi-window browsing in mobile environments is not always implemented (e.g. in in-app browsers), making this not-an-option. Authorisation in an iframe would overcome these shortcomings while providing easy, unobtrusive and consistent user experience. We are following the workflow as described in and . The login page (2nd link > step 1 > 1st picture) displays fine in the iframe and the user is able to enter his/her Autodesk ID credentials. After that the user is redirected to the OAuth consent page. The consent page (2nd link > step 1 > 2nd picture) is served with header which in an iframe obviously fails to load: . However, if the user has consented beforehand (e.g. in a separate window) the consent page is skipped and user is immediately redirected to the provided callback uri along with the authorisation code as desired (response code , header ). This raises the question if the is by-design and deliberate? What is the benefit in this scenario to disable OAuth consent page in iframe while allowing login page? Would it somehow be possible to disable the header or add an exception for the origin defined in the Autodesk Forge App as Callback URL?

To ask for permissions from a user to retrieve an access token, you redirect the user to a consent page.

In general, the migration went fine, however we noticed that for some models we have issues with the far cutting planes of the camera. I have figured out that this happens because the model contains some elements that are very far from the rest of the model and thus the bounding box of the entire model is magnitudes larger than it should be. This results in camera and . It seems that far should be higher in order to not hide parts of the model when zooming out. For now, we have been able to workaround the issue be specifying a the ""nearRadius"" when loading the model, but since we have to set it to a value like 50 or 100 in order to not have far plane issues, we still have some near plane clipping issues. I was wondering if there is any possibility to fix the model once it is loaded, so that the viewer uses a more realistic bounding box for the model. I have found out so far that during the load it already sets the variable to true and therefore is not using the but either the passed value in the load options or 1. I was able to set nearRadius to a negative value to have the same behaviour as with , but due to the large bounding box of the model, we still experience clipping issues. In order to fix the model I have already tried: Excluding the ids of the elements that are far away with in the load options Setting the visibility of these elements to off using Use to set the bounding box (as suggested in ) However, still returns the huge bounding box.

Questions on this: 1: The package bundling system allows for multiple Revit versions to be supported.  Does DA require that each bundle support only one Revit version or is there a way to support multiple versions that I'm missing? 2: What happens if the engine for the activity is different from the bundle?  Is that just unsupported and if so why is there an engine argument in both? App bundles are referenced by their ID.  Most of the examples show the ID as something like 'DeleteWallsApp' or whatever.  However, if you truly need multiple app bundles for multiple Revit versions then would you actually want to use ID's like 'DeleteWallsApp2018' and 'DeleteWallsApp2020', etc.?  You couldn't have multiple ID's that are the same so that seems the most pertinent way to do it.  Is this correct? Bundles and activities are also referenced by their alias.  If I understand they are meant for dev/staging/production aliases for testing vs. production code, etc.  If so, is it recommended then to have those aliases for each bundle?

This is in the context of a web application I am working to build that enables: Uploading 3D models in a variety of file formats Interacting with these models using the AutoDesk Viewer Displaying mass properties, eg volume and surface area, alongside the viewer ( subject of this post ) Background Some file formats have very reliable volume information that is computed and written to the file by the authoring application. For these files, we can access volume as a property via AutoDesk Viewer. Other formats, however, do not carry volume information - at least not in a manner that is openly accessible using tools other than the authoring application (prime example here is SolidWorks). This leaves us with a giant gap to fill - we need to recompute the model's volume using what's in the file. Known Workarounds and Options AutoDesk published a blog post detailing an approach for . I think it's an ideal solution for use cases that can afford to trade accuracy for a bump in performance - and it centers everything in the viewer  making development and subsequent maintenance simpler. This application, however, cannot rely on such approximations. I'm left reviewing options for leveraging the to: Load the model file Rely on iLogic to trigger a re-computation of the model's part properties (perhaps ) Push that data back to my web application Where I Need Help My understanding is that an and are defined ahead of time and then every uploaded model would be . I am hoping for guidance in: whether this is the only approach or whether there are other options worth considering from an order of operations/workflow standpoint to maximize performance Current Thinking For example, I'm thinking that my first step after the source file is uploaded is to immediately initialize two parallel processes: the first to translate the source file for the viewer, the second to spin up Inventor and trigger the related downstream process to get volume. The other option I'm considering is handling all of the work in Inventor - and pushing out an SVF file to the viewer that's enriched with volume data. The advantage of this approach is that my frontend will have only one source for volume data, (it will be in the enriched SVF no matter whether it was supplied in the original file or not). In an ideal world I'd be able to only invoke the Design Automation API when volume data is missing from the source file - but I'd only know that after translating the file and bringing it back to the viewer. Given that many of our files are created in SolidWorks and other high-end proprietary CAD platforms, my working hypothesis is that we'll be needing to fill in volume gaps more often than not.",88,4628,programmatically recompute precise part volume thirdparty file use forge apis,look good practice performanceguide recommendation recomputing model volume miss source file context web application work build enable upload   model variety file format interact model use autodesk viewer display mass property eg volume surface area alongside viewer subject post background file format reliable volume information compute write file author application file access volume property via autodesk viewer format however carry volume information least manner openly accessible use tool author application prime example solidwork leave we giant gap fill need recompute model volume use what s file know workaround option autodesk publish blog post detail approach think ideal solution use case afford trade accuracy bump performance center everything viewer make development subsequent maintenance simple application however can not rely approximation leave review option leverage load model file rely ilogic trigger recomputation model part property perhaps push datum back web application need help understanding define ahead time every uploaded model would hope guidance whether approach whether option worth consider order operationsworkflow standpoint maximize performance current thinking example think first step source file upload immediately initialize two parallel process first translate source file viewer second spin inventor trigger related downstream process get volume option consider handle work inventor push svf file viewer that s enriched volume data advantage approach frontend one source volume datum enrich svf matter whether supply original file ideal world i d able invoke design automation api volume datum miss source file i d know translate file bring back viewer give many file create solidwork highend proprietary cad platform work hypothesis well need fill volume gap often

After logout, if user wants to login again, and I send him to , it's going straight to my callback with the previous user already authenticated instead of prompting for new login. Seems like Autodesk is storing the session as a cookie so the only way to switch users after authorizing is to clear out the browser cache/data Is there a way to force logout, or something similar to ""Sign in as another user""? This is my first time doing oauth, so I am not sure I am missing something, but seems like there should be way to force clear out the session and force a new login. Edit Let me further clarify what I am trying to achieve: Here is what I have.
1. I direct the user to the authentication page directing it to: The user logins in with his Autodesk credentials The authorization flow redirect's the user to `mycallback.com/callback/?code={{code}} My backend get's the parameter from the url request, and makes a request to The request returns, among other things, an I store the to the user's session, and use that to make the next requests to the API. Up to this point, it works as I expect. Now I want to log the user out, and potentially sign in as a different user. A /logout end point on my server clears the user session, eliminating the stored access_token. Once the back end realized there is not active session/access_token, it redirect the user to the authentication flow (step #1 above). At this point, I would expect to see another Autodesk login page, but instead, Autodesk's server automatically authorizes without a new login, and redirects user to call back, and the user logs in again. So to rephrase my question, how do change the behavior on #9 above, so that the user has to re-enter his credential? I am running into this often during development, where I login with my personal account, then I logout, and I would like to login with my work account.
Currently, the only way i can do that, is by Clearing my browser's cache. 
That leads me to think Autodesk is storing the session in the browser, and that's why it's re-authenticating without getting new credentials. The same behaviour happens on your dm.autodesk.io
After the first login, if i try to authorize again, I am not prompted for an login the 2nd time, instead it automatically re-logins in the first user I logged in with. If I understand what's happening correctly, seems that the API should have an end-point that we can call when I user logs out to force a re-authentication. Makes sense?

Now my question is: how do one distinguish between them while uploading a file?

Unfortunately I am not able to find an unambiguous property that would clearly state which one allows uploading everything and which one doesn't.

The model defines a Survey point a Base Project point ), and a model room. The model room contains an element with a coordinate I am trying to make sense of how these points inside the model get transformed and translated after upload to Forge platform. I used this function ( ) to to obtain the bounding box of the model in Forge Viewer, and found these: , and Additionally, I made these initial assumptions: Unit assumption: 1 point in northing & easting coordinate provided in Revit model translates directly to a point in X & Y of Forge Viewer. Origin assumption: I assumed that the origin of the Forge Viewer lies in point in the Viewer API. Additionally the viewer uses the model's Survey Point or the Project Base point as the origin. The element of the Revit model would fall inside the Forge Viewer model's bounding box However, the information of the bounding box (with ranging from respectively) does not seem to contain the coordinate of the element defined inside the room model if it were on survey point (with the element's at with respect to survey point), or if it were on project base point (with element's at with respect to project base point). Also, referring to question, it might be that the model coordinate might be offset by a global offset obtainable by this command: ( ). However, when I run this command is returned. Suppose if the offset is somehow correct, it seems the unit scaling of Northing/Easting to Forge's X/Y is different than my assumption. I wish to ask which part of the assumptions I made above is faulty? If my unit assumption is an issue, how is the Northing/Easting unit converted to Forge Viewer's X & Y unit? If my origin assumption is faulty in addition to the first assumption, how does Forge set the origin in the viewer?

It requires that user selects two points in the viewer and define the distance with proper units. My plan is that I will have the points defined in my model at a fixed distance. I will not need user input for this. How do I add the distance, unit, and size so as to programmatically set the calibration? Edit: The workaround. I need that the default units be meters and it should correctly show 1 meter on the model to 1 meter as measured by measurement tool. For the time being, what I did is - I manually calibrate the model using calibrate tool to meters by picking two known points in the model. Then I used this to get the scale factor - (I used the above code lines in the developer console of the browser while interacting with the viewer simultaneously.) which gave me this value factor = 0.039369.
I am adding this scale factor in my code once the model is loaded again. This seems to solve the issue for the models that I have with me .

In this case the viewer rotates/moves and the element is NOT selected. When logging the events there are plenty of mouse down/up events along with mouse moves when it doesnt work. When select does work a single click event occurs. Double click seems to work ok.
Zoom/rotate etc using standard tools works ok. Using the keyboard cover touch pad that you can get for the Surface pro to move and click works as expected and the element is selected. Running same application on a GETAC Windows 10 ruggadised tablet the select element works correctly so it seems related to the Surface Pro. Unable to change browsers as cordova apps use IE11 on windows and that is currently fixed. The only solution i can think of for the moment is to remove the standard navigation tools completely (somehow) and recreate a select mode tool that would ignore any mouse moves and use button down event to select element.

All the colors used are THREE.Vector4 with the opacity set to 1. In this way the themingColor is non blended with the ""natural"" color of the object but it ""covers"" object. To improve the user experience we'd like to allow the user to dimm the objects not affected by issue instead of set the gray color using setThemingColor.

I’ve also tried to get projects with the hub id’s listed below, but get 404 errors saying that they do not exist. I am also not sure if the warnings at the end of the response are the two hubs I’m looking for, because I’m writing my request wrong, or something else.

I am currently storing the refresh token in an SQL database with only one row and column, containing the refresh token. Steps regarding the token are as follows: When a user signs in, a GET method is called to retrieve the latest token from the database. Returndata.php simply connects to the SQL DB and retrieves the row from the table. Get method code: The token is returned and used to get an access token for the user. When the access token is retrieved, it comes with a refresh token, which is subsequently saved in the SQL database in the same row as the previous refresh token. Savesettings.php simply connects to the DB and updates the single row, with the new refresh token. Code for POST method to store refresh token: For the most part, this method works fine, however there have been a couple times where it has bugged out. I believe this is due to a concurrency issue. Where if two users are accessing the DB at very similar times, the data may become corrupted or the wrong data may be given. To fix this, I know I need to use a semaphore so that other requests wait until the first is done before executing. How can I use a semaphore to achieve this? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am very stuck on this issue. Thanks. Cheers!!

I have access to high accuracy GPS data and also omega/phi/kappa rotation data. The goal is to move the viewer camera into position when I select a photo, so that we get a fairly good view of that part of the model from the photo. So far, we are working with a single model and I want to verify that I'm using the transforms correctly so that this works with other models. Also, I need to match camera orientation using omega/phi/kappa, and I want to know if I also need to transform orientation data. The model comes from Revit originally. Here are the various transforms I have found so far using . GlobalOffset (Vector3) placementWithOffset (Matrix4) - seems to be just the inverse of GlobalOffset as a matrix? placementTransform (Matrix4) - generally undefined, I've seen some hints that this is a user defined matrix. refPointTransform (Matrix4) Also, there are some transforms in the : metadata.georeference.positionLL84 (Array[3]) - this is where the model's GPS coords are stored metadata.georeference.refPointLMV (Array[3]) - no idea what this is, and it has huge and seemingly random values on many models. For example, on my current model it is metadata.[custom values].angleToTrueNorth - I guess this is specifying whether the model is aligned to true or magnetic north? metadata.[custom values].refPointTransform - (Array[12]) - data used to create the matrix above I have been able to get the position data into viewer space using these steps: Use the extension function to convert lon/lat/alt to viewer coords. Take the converted data and apply various transforms until it is correctly positioned in model space. Questions: do I need to apply some transforms to rotation data as well? Am I applying the transforms correctly? EDIT: figured out that the matrix already encodes the , so I'm clearly doing something wrong in applying that twice.

I have identified 6 files: Some of this files are pretty simple to understand: objects_ids.json.gz - This file has the same content as the _objecs_id table, basically the external id and dbids (which is the row number -1). objects_attrs.json.gz - Again this file is equivalent to a table on the sdb database, very easy to read. Here we have the definition for the attributes used in the modelviewer. It has the following ""columns"": id,name,category,data_type,data_type_context,description,display_name,flags,display_precision objects_vals.json.gz Equivalent to _objects_val table, here we have two things, ID and VALUE (for the attributes defined on the previous json document). Until now things are pretty easy... We have the object identification, attributes and it's possible values, but the problem is, how to make then work together? Right now they are isolated, so they're useless right now. I need to relate a object identification with it's attributes with it's values. To do that in the model.mdb we can join the tables, with the main relationship table: _objects_eav
It has the entity_id, the attribute_id and value_id. So to join the data and have the information we need we can simply do: But there is no json file equivalent to the _objects_eav table... Instead we have the following files objects_avs.json.gz, objects_offs.json.gz, objects_viewables.json.gz Right now I have no idea how to merge the data between these files and get the whole information needed. Any toughs about this? Other thoughts:
Alternatively I could use the model.sdb to access the data, but I rather use the JSON, since they are way smaller (30 x smaller than the model.sdb, that's a massive amount). I could also get some data using the methods provided by the viewer objects in JavaScript, but then I would be stuck with the methods and properties provided by the viewer, and unfortunately they do not fulfill all my requirements.

I'm using Autodesk.Viewing.MarkupsCore library to draw annotations over model in forge viewer. For that I'm loading Autodesk.Viewing.MarkupsCore extension as _markupsExtension . I tried drawing some markup annotation and saved viewer state. When I tried loading these previously drawn annotations, It failed to restore viewer state , but it was loading annotations data properly. Why does it fail to restore state while being in markup viewing mode ? What is difference between _markupsExtension.viewer.restoreState (_state) and viewer.restoreState (_state) ================================ EDITED ============================= Is there any way where I could stay within editing mode/viewing mode and change viewer's state? I am saving all markups in a list view in different sessions or file per session (referring ).
e.g. 1) I moved model to the top and drawn arrow pointing to particular object and I saved it with name ""MarkupA.json"".
2) I moved model to front and zoomed it out so that it went far from camera. Then I drawn Square markup and stored it with name ""MarkupB.json"".
3) Then again I kept model to default iso (home) mode and drawn text annotation and saved it with name ""MarkupC.json"". All these markups are listed in the UI panel like a tree. So when am clicking on any particular name, that markup and its model viewer state has to get restored without change in any markup mode. I have checked this similar functionality in bim360. When I stored different markups in BIM360, it stored all markups in its database and small thumbnail screenshot appeared for its relevant markup card. I viewed all markups in markup panel or comment panel. When I clicked on specific thumbnail, every markup appeared with appropriate stored viewer state. I am trying to get similar functionality in forge viewer using new Markups core extension and customised its markup code to store states with markups. When I tried to load each markup, it seems like markup is getting loaded but its viewer state is not able to get restored neither in edit mode nor in viewing mode. I understood that restoring state is not possible if we are in markups mode. But what if I want to show the previously stored drawn markup on particular view? The workaround which I tried to switch between markup is as follow, On click of another markup - a) leave viewing mode b) restore model with stored state c) enter viewing mode. d) load its markup svg. The issue with this is it is taking too much time taking too much time to reload markup with restored state. Can you please tell me if we have any other workaround or approach to achieve loading and restoring markup and its viewer state synchronously?",72,4636,restore view state directly markupedit markupview mode,reference implement   markup feature forge viewer use autodeskviewingmarkupscore library draw annotation model forge viewer load autodeskviewingmarkupscore extension markupsextension try draw markup annotation save view state try load previously draw annotation fail restore viewer state loading annotation datum properly fail restore state markup view mode difference markupsextensionviewerrestorestate state viewerrestorestate state edit way could stay within edit modeviewe mode change viewer state save markup list view different session file per session refer eg   move model top draw arrow point particular object save name   move model front zoom go far camera draw square markup store name   keep model default iso home mode draw text annotation save name markupcjson markup list ui panel like tree click particular name markup model viewer state get restore without change markup mode check similar functionality   store different markup   store markup database small thumbnail screenshot appear relevant markup card view markup markup panel comment panel click specific thumbnail every markup appear appropriate stored viewer state try get similar functionality forge viewer use new markup core extension customise markup code store state markup try load markup seem like markup getting load viewer state able get restore neither edit mode view mode understand restore state possible markup mode want show previously store draw markup particular view workaround try switch markup follow click another markup leave view mode b restore model store state c enter view mode load markup svg issue take much time take much time reload markup restore state please tell workaround approach achieve loading restore markup viewer state synchronously

Basically, I initialize the viewer, and then LoadDocument and LoadModel for each model that user chooses to view, dynamically. These are mostly NVC files (what I used for testing), which are sharing the coordinate system. Models getting dynamically loaded and getting 'stitched' correctly. However, coordinate system is getting screwed up when the second model gets loaded - not always but in some cases (in v6.3 - haven't checked previous versions). When this happens, I can notice the followings: When I click 'home' icon in the viewer, it doesn't show the full aggregated model but only shows the first loaded model in the center and rest go outside screen. When I click an element to select, it selects something else (with an offset), and some cases selects nothing (meaning, clicked coordinates has been interpreted  incorrectly). I have tried multiple combinations and this problem seems to happen when first loaded model is not occupying full size of the aggregated model (say, one floor of the building). I figured out a solution though. After loading the models (every time when user choose some), if I 'hide' all models and 'show' them again, it fixes the problems with click and AGGREGATED_SELECTION event. This is not a nice user experience because I want to be able to load the models in the background while user is moving around the previously aggregated model-set. If I hide/show after loading the new one, it will be annoying to user. Is there a way to 'reset' the coordinate system of the viewer (to the same effect what happens when hide/show the models)? I would appreciate some help to get around this issue. Thanks

When loading the SVF derrivative into the viewer, doing outputs: In order to load the models with the right coordinates I use the following options: IFC 1 and 2: Obj: The rationale here is that the IFC models are located far away from the origin, while the Obj model is located at origin. Using for the IFCs seems necessary to get them to align in the viewer, using is necessary to put the Obj close to the IFC models. I'm struggling with the following problems here: Navigating the models is hard, when highlighting the Obj model, it seems like it is set to using y-up or something, making it hard to do orientation navigation for the other models. When trying to change zoom, only the Obj seems to be affected. Could this be due to different scale settings? EDIT 1 : Looks like making the Obj cube the same size as the other models fixes the zooming problem. 
Also, if loading the IFC files first, the orientation navigation is right. It's only when loading the OBJ file first that we get the ""y-up orientation"" problem Edit 2 : The orientation navigation problem can be fixed with .
Is it possible to also control behavior like this globally instead always letting the different models set the behavior?",61,2671,forge viewer can not view multiple different model properly,trouble load different model viewer suspect problem come mix different unit meter millimeter model   model ifc   use millimeter unit loading svf derrivative viewer output ifc   use millimeter unit get output ifc   obj model simple cube center cube origin     seem inherent unit loading svf derrivative viewer output order load model right coordinate use follow option ifc    obj rationale ifc model locate far away origin obj model locate origin use ifcs seem necessary get align viewer use necessary put obj close ifc model struggle follow problem navigate model hard highlight obj model seem like set use yup something make hard orientation navigation model try change zoom obj seem affected could due different scale setting edit   look like make obj cube size model fix zoom problem also load ifc file first orientation navigation right load obj file first get yup orientation problem edit   orientation navigation problem fix possible also control behavior like globally instead always let different model set behavior

I need this custom mesh to be placed in sceneAfter, since I want to enable transparency.

Which is inspired by this stackoverflow answer: , but was not satisfied since it overwrites third-party code that may change later. Secondly, having an invisible clone (using material's visible property instead of geometry) of custom mesh in viewer.impl.scene, such that it changes visible bound of viewer.

The classes eTransmit, TransmissionOptions and TransmissionGraph are used.
Unfortunately, the function of the eTransmit class ""TransmitFiles"" always returns the value ""False"". The output file remains unchanged.
To get the app running, the eTransmitForRevitDB.dll also had to be uploaded to Forge with the compiled addin dlls.
Because eTransmit does not run on an open Revit project, I used the example of ""learn.forge.designautomation"" to implement the Revit file input/output.
I searched in the forum and found nothing.
Is it possible to use the eTransmit dll in Forge?
What could be the problem?

I did some experiments in a model by create some section planes on 2 different surfaces (in the same model and session), and ended up with significantly different sized Gizmo.

I looked into the section style to see difference, but I am not able to see any difference from in the 2 different sections, so therefor my questions are now:
What defines the size of the Gizmo, and why does it change from object to object?
Are we able to control the size? Hope someone has some inputs that might help me forward. File used in example is a DGN file and Viewer is version 7.37. Thanks in advance!

identify property between two versions of the same model name: for .rvt models it is mostly unique, but there are some duplications
sometimes (for example the same property with different flags,
readonly and not); for .ifc files it is not unique at all category + displayName: the problem with this
fields is that after using design automation API (to change and
re-save model) category/displayName can be translated into English
(but initially they can be, for example, in German) Now we are using the combination of 'name + category + displayName' to identify the property, but it is not the solution, because this combination still is not unique in some rare cases (it is data lost for us) and it doesn't solve the problem with property names translation using Design Automation API.

The first one is based on javascript. In that project, all added extensions just do what what I expect ! I can load models, change materials ( colors,textures,shaders) and add,scale,rotate and translate meshes.
BUT with my second forge-viewer project, based on typescript and react.
I totaly got stuck and need some help.The problem has to do with the way I import and use THREE in my project. Unfortunately, I really did NOT find any helpful example.
where someone describes the way how to use Forge-viewer,typescript,react and THREE ( e.g addMesh() )
ok, coming to the point, the problem is... I just cannot add an mesh into the scene !!!
not by using modelBuilder.addMesh( newMesh), and also NOT by using viewer.impl.scene.add( newMesh ); usually I get the three-error-message object not an instance of THREE.Object3D even though my created THREE Object is for very sure an Object3D and is created as const mesh = THREE.Mesh();
ok, I already know, that this is error-message is a very clear indication, that there are 2 different three.js versions in play !!! As I know, the current Forge-Viewer – Version 7.3 use THREE.js Revision 7.1 and when I start my Project I get within google-devtools (in console-info)
the information THREE.WebGLRenderer 7.1 !!!
so , I use the right THREE version ...
BUT, the problems probably is, how I do import three !!!
In my project I have installed three by using npm install three0.71 –save and for the type-definitions npm install @types/three and
npm install @types/forge-viewer   (^7.32.2) and in one of my extension written in typescript I really hope that someone will give me the right advice,
and again I already know, that it has to do with the import of THREE.js
I should not load or install it globally ... with npm install
but how and from where ????

Moreover the list is sometimes freezing or scrollbar is getting stuck at the bottom. If I dont use the performance and css is better but I still loose click events on the table. The reason why I use with an extreme number is the row style. As default the background color of rows are black and white, it is not easy to read and confusing. But anyhow even if I don't use I am loosing onClick functions when I scroll down on high row number lists... Is there a way to avoid this 'refresh' or is there an optimal row number to keep in mind when we make development on DataTable ? As an example I've created 285 row list with random strings to check if the problem is arising from our data structure but unfortunately same problem occurs in example too. Do we have the chance to optimize it ?

Currently the only solution I came up with is to store the position of the camera when taking the screenshot and then when the 3d model is updated, have another computer in the background go in the viewer and take the screenshots again at the same location. This does not seems to be a very elegant solution so I would like to know if there's an alternative, like a way to generate 2d views from an api call or maybe use the Design Automation API with the viewer to take the screenshots ? Another thing i'm struggling with is getting precise measure of the 2ds views i'm generating, my current solution is to calculate the distance between the camera and the cut plane and then use the fov to get an approximate measure, the formula looks like this : but it is very dependent on the user facing the plane cut at a 90° angle and i'm thinking there should be something better to do with the measure tool.

In that model, we save camera positions at certain points. Sometimes a model will be updated, adding an element for example. Now if we load the camera positions, they seem to have 'moved'. After some investigation, we found that for the 2 models, the globaloffset differs. If we load the updated model, with the globaloffset of the previous model, then the camera positions match again. So i guess the globaloffset is calculated to match the center of the model on 0,0,0 and by adding an element, the center switches, causing an offset of the camera positions. I updated the app to load the model always with the first globaloffset. So far so good. However, once we do that, moving the model really close behaves weird. If the offset is changed a little, then the model shifts a bit left-right when you get it close using the scrollwheel, instead of a smooth transition. And when the offset is changed a lot, it seems that getting the model really close is not even possible anymore (by using the scrollwheel). Furthermore, when really close to the model, selection of an element is of. IE. i click at an element and the element next to it is selected (or none at all). Which makes me wonder about 2 things: Is globaloffset usable to translate the position of the model a bit, or should we leave it alone? Is there an other easy way of translating xyz of the complete model?",60,1511,forge view globaloffset change break move select,app use forge viewer display   model model save camera position certain point sometimes model update add element example load camera position seem move investigation find   model globaloffset differ load update model globaloffset previous model camera position match guess globaloffset calculate match center model   add element center switch cause offset camera position update app load model always first globaloffset far good however move model really close behave weird offset change little model shift bit leftright get close use scrollwheel instead smooth transition offset change lot seem get model really close even possible anymore use scrollwheel furthermore really close model selection element ie click element element next select none make wonder   thing globaloffset usable translate position model bit leave alone easy way translate xyz complete model

The website works like this: The user selects a machine number and all the information about the machine will pop up. This includes stations within the machine, as well as all the individual parts within each station. My task was to add autodesk-forge to the website. Currently I have successfully used the autodesk-forge viewer so that whenever a machine is picked, the user can press a button, and the model of the entire machine will pop up to be viewed. The next step is to have the viewer be controlled by external buttons on the website. We want it to work as such: A machine is picked by the user. After this all the information such as stations, and parts within each station in the machine will pop up (this is completed). The user clicks a ""view model"" button which will use the forge viewer to make the machine pop up on the website (This has been completed by me). Once the forge viewer with the model is on the screen, we want the viewer to be able to be controlled by external buttons already on the site. For example, if there is a machine with name MC-000, and in that machine there is a station named ST010, within that station there are many parts, for example a gear. When the machine MC-000 is being viewed by the user, we want to be able to click an external button which is already made (for example ST010) and the viewer will automatically zoom in and highlight that station within the machine. We also want the same for parts within the machine. When a machine is picked, its stations, as well as the parts within the stations are already printed out within our website. We now want to be able to click the stations, or parts and have the viewer automatically zoom into that part# or station#. I have found a similar code sample . In this example, parts of the viewer are controlled by buttons not within the viewer. For example, when the 'engine' button is clicked, the viewer will automatically zoom into the engine. The problem with this example, is that all of the positions are hard-coded into the code, meaning that the position of the engine is already within the code. I cannot do this as we have many different machines with thousands of parts, so it would be impossible for me to hard-code them all in. Is something like this possible to do with autodesk-forge viewer. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!

This is the link to the tutorial I am now trying to link that app/program with a simple login/authentication system but have been unsuccessful. Do I need to use a nodejs authentication system as I have used that for autodesk forge. Also, how would I go about hiding certain models from the viewer based on who is logged in. Any examples where someone used a login system with forge would help a lot, also any tips and any guidance would be very much appreciated as I am very new to web-design.

Thanks for all your help I am now using the three legged authorization.

I am trying to create a website for our customers where they can log in and view our models that we provide for them. They will only have access to the models through the app. However certain models must be hidden as one customer should only be able to view the models that apply to them, not all in the account. Is something like this possible. Thanks for the help.

Unfortunately though, I have encountered a couple of problems, one of which I think I have solved and one which I am guessing is more to do with the Autodesk Viewer Applications programmed interaction with the model derivative API. Initially I uploaded our services model with supporting architectural and structural models but the phase the solitary 3D view created in the viewer was ""Existing"" with a filter of ""Show All"". I managed to get around this by creating a 3D view in each model just called ""3D"" and setting the phase and filter as I like. Happy days. Could this also have been better solved by setting generateMasterViews to true during the POST job on a custom Forge viewer app? However, I am only getting some elements from the services model come through into the Autodesk Viewer application. Most notably it's missing ducts, sanitary pipework, cable trays, radiators. In the ""3D"" 3D view I have created everything is phased correctly, no issues from worksets, visibility graphics, view discipline is coordination (doesnt work to change to mechanical) and everything looks hunky dory in Revit. In the viewer though it's a different story. Even if I upload the services model on it's own. Strangely, in the 2d sheet views all the equipment and infrastructure is there fine, just in 3D it is now. So my knowledge of Javascript and the Forge API is quite rudimental but I'm guessing the problem is with Autodesk Viewer's implementation of the model derivative API for when the model is translated to svf. Does this sound correct? Could it a bug within Autodesk's viewer app? I'm not too sure what the best Autodesk forum to post in would be. Could it be a bug within the model derivative API? Or is it a setting that is beyond my knowledge? I guessing I'm at a place where what I'm really after is a custom Forge viewer application to design in the functionality I am after, in this case control of phasing in the .svf file output and ensuring everything is coming through in the view. Not the most interesting post by any stretch and if you're still reading now, thanks. But I'm sure I can't be the only one experiencing this problem.

Did not have any effect. 3) I have tried to add the model to the function call: 4) I have tried to run the function on the level of the model: 5) I have from within my code tested to make sure I have access to the viewer instance. And this works. Is anybody else experiencing the same issue or can replicate the bug?
I hope somebody can help us out. EDIT: More infor after Petr Broz answer: ""What version of the viewer are you using?"": We are using v. 7.* ""Do you see any error logs in the console after setting the theming color?"": I see no error logs.

The API is recognizing the ID. 
The problem occurs in the response of this endpoint to create the signed url: I'm using the wip.dm.emea as bucket because the file is stored in the EU BIM360 OSS. The response is a 403 Forbidden : Is it even possible to get the File ID like in this example ?
Because this Solution requires a 3-Legged-Auth Flow which is not possible for a complete Automation. The thing which makes me question is, that you can achieve this Workflow in plane Forge. But not in BIM360 where i have no control over the Buckets that are created by the System!? I think this is an architectural missmatch between the Forge API and the BIM360 implementation!?

Model-Derivative Translation Issue: I have run into a failed translation error which has also popped up in other threads However my case is somewhat unique, and other answers are not applicable. Previous cases have failed due to incorrect Revit version (apparently the translation may work on a 2016 version but not a 2019 version), or corruption during the upload of the file. This cannot be applicable for me as the .rvt to .svf translation was successful for this model, only my .rvt to .ifc translation has failed, also I am not uploading through the app, rather accessing files that are already on BIM360 docs. Another strange part of this behavior is that the .rvt->.ifc translation has been successful for earlier versions of the same model. This leads me to believe that perhaps there is a file size issue where the latest version of the model is too large for translation, although I haven't found any limits on the file size in the model-derivative documentation. 2. Model-Derivative Download Issue: Routing the download of a translated file through my server before downloading again from server to client, in order to use the 3-legged OAuth token, means having to download the same file twice (once from data-management api endpoint to server, secondly from server to client). This is problematic for large models. 
Currently my solution has been to just pass the 3-legged OAuth token and file URI to the client and have the request go straight from client to autodesk endpoint, although I thought this was bad practice. I have not found any samples which incorporate this download endpoint, a NodeJS one would be optimal for me. Also I wish there was a content-length header attached to this endpoint to give a better idea of download progress. The relevant endpoints for my issues are both here: Translate: Note: I have used ""type"": ifc rather than ""type"": obj, as my output format on this endpoint; that is not the issue.

These models are then further adjusted in CAD, for eventual 3D printing. MY GOAL: I am trying to improve the precision of my 3D models by providing a survey file with known markers (GCPs) positions and I have consulted the API documents . My Questions: Which coordinate system string to specify given my ( non -geographical) arbitrary origin imaging application? Is there is a way to provide cartesian coordinates locations in the < gpc > tag, and if so, what is the syntax? When I should define a location as a GPC point and when I should define a location as a "" checkpoint ""? My Motivation for providing survey file to Forge Without providing survey information, I am finding that the resulting Forge models are significantly distorted , even when I use images that provided good models previously with RECAP. When I previously modeled with the RECAP software, I initially had similarly distorted models until I provided RECAP with my marker positions.  After I provided precise marker positions to RECAP, I got excellent models. So I expect that if I can provide the marker locations to Forge I will again get very accurate output models. However, because my application is not geographical , I want to provide my marker positions to Forge in terms of either spherical coordinates or c artesian coordinates from my own arbitrarily defined origin point. I can provide distances in millimeters , and angles in degrees . I can't figure out from the which coordinate system name to provide. I believe that I could probably provide the spherical coordinates from my arbitrary origin in the < gcp > tag , if I knew which coordinate system is appropriate for altitudes measured in millimeters. But I can't determine which coordinate system string I need to provide. I see the very lengthy list of known coordinate system strings referred to in the documentation,  but they are just labels with no explanation of what they are. I can provide cartesian coordinates , but I don't know which coordinate system string would be appropriate for that.  And even if I did, the < gcp > tags in the example don't illustrate any x= y= z= format. Can someone provide me more information on use of survey files for my application? About my set up I have more than 20 images from known vantage points all around a controlled target imaging zone. All around the target zone I have fiduciary marker points , with at least 3 markers visible in each image, and frequently more. For every marker I know which images that marker appears in , and at which xpixel and ypixel location it is centered. BTW, in RECAP these locations were defined in terms of % of the frame, rather than pixel positions. That enables more precision than a single pixel. Is that no longer possible? I also know the physical location of each marker in 3-space , r elative to an arbitrary origin (0,0,0) at the center of my imaging zone.

Now suppose I extracted 10 different object files from one model. that means in bucket 30 new file URN will be generated.
And it is getting very hard to identify. The Solution could have been if I extract obj geometry from model, I should get that particular obj, mtl, zips guid. IF I am getting only 3 ids then I can map those and download it from bucket. 
What is happening now is I am getting all obj's guid (suppose 30 ) after calling get manifest .

The section of code I have below doesn't actually seem to be the culprit since it wasn't changed before the error stopped being thrown. As far as I can tell, nothing else that should throw that error has been changed either, so I'm not sure what happened. If I figure out what fixed the issue I'll post it as an answer. For now I'll just leave this question up in case other people have this issue as well. I'm creating a web app that uses the model viewer api from forge. I'm getting a strange error when calling model.getProperties in my code (where model is from Viewer3D.model), and I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to fix it. The stack trace in the error doesn't show any of my own code, only code from the api, but through debugging I've been able to isolate it to the model.getPropeties call inside a SELECTION_CHANGED_EVENT handler. The error is as follows: I've wrapped the call to model.getProperties in a promise so I can await it in my async function. The function seems to work and return the correct value, but it also seems to asynchronously throw an error. I've wrapped the awaited call in a try catch statement but the error is never caught. Instead, the error is thrown just after the call ""succeeds"" but before any other calls are made. I can see from the debugger that I get the expected values from the function, but the error is still thrown. What is also strange is that this error is only thrown after one call has been made successfully. I use this to get the properties of the user selected item. The first selection will work correctly, but all subsequent selections will throw the error. Everything else works fine, including the portions of code that rely on ""properties"".

As an example project I use the TGA model provided by Autodesk. ( rme_advanced_sample_project.rvt) If you add all instances to the scene you get a polygon count of about 1.3M.
For the computer this is no problem at all. The model is downloaded in about 1 min and displayed completely.
For my iPhone ( iPhone 8) this is clearly too big.
As soon as I start the AR Scene and download the model, the memory requirement rises to over 1.2 GB (bevore 0,15GB) and crashes the app. Even if you exclude some instances (walls, ceilings, etc.) before processing the scene to display only the technical building equipment, the model is still too big for the iPhone. Are there possibilities to reduce the mesh with the ar-vr-toolkit api . Do I have to do this manually in Revit? Edit: 27.06.18
Here is the model i want to display in AR (Tris: 2.8m, Verts: 2.4M). Steps:
1) Upload the original .rvt file (70mb) to my bucket.
2) Translated the file via forge.
3) Created a scene with ar-vr-toolkit api.
4) Processed scene witha ar-vr-toolkit api.
5) Downloaded the scene to unity.
6) Created a prefab. The Meshes are way to detailed. The Graphics would not change a lot if i reduce the Vertex count to 10-15%. 
In Unity i can use assets like Mesh Simplify ( ) to reduce the count.
An other way is to export the model to e.g. 3D max or Maya to reduce the count.
But i want to try to do this automatically. My question is: Is there a way to to this with Forge?",50,2320,ar vr toolkit reduce model mesh display ar,way reduce mesh polygon example project use tga model provide autodesk rmeadvancedsampleprojectrvt add instance scene get polygon count   computer problem model download   min display completelyfor iphone iphone   clearly bigas soon start ar scene download model memory requirement rise   gb bevore   crash app even exclude instance wall ceiling etc processing scene display technical building equipment model still big iphone possibility reduce mesh arvrtoolkit api manually revit edit   model want display ar tris   vert    upload original rvt file    translate file via   create scene arvrtoolkit   process scene witha arvrtoolkit   download scene   create prefab mesh way detailed graphic would change lot reduce vertex count   unity use asset like mesh simplify reduce countan way export model eg   max maya reduce countbut want try automatically question way forge

These data are then transparently sent to a different rendering system for the project upon which I'm working. However, I'm noticing that there are incorrect rotations in groups of extracted objects. Not all objects, just groupings. As an example, here is the Forge Viewer rendering of a group of objects (the long poles), with correct rotation. You can see all the poles evenly placed along the base-plate's edge and equally placed with regards to each other. Whereas in the rendered extracted geometry, the grouping of objects are correctly placed with relation to each other (equally, 3x3), but the group as a whole is rotated slightly along the Z-axis in relation to the bottom plate. This is the type of behaviour I would expect if the individual poles were all child objects of some parent object (perhaps an invisible grouping object), and the rotation of the parent would pivot all the poles in the SVF but that rotation wasn't applied during geometry extraction. 
This happens with all groupings with regards to individual objects in a scene. While looking at , I get the strong impression that there is a 2nd rotational aspect but I cannot see how that applies when reading the SVF directly. Question: Obviously I'm not looking for a direct code solution, but to confirm the structure of the SVF pack files. Looking at , I don't see anything which would imply a parent-child grouping but haven't managed to think of an alternative cause. So, are there such parent-child transform relationships in the SVF pack files, or a global rotational component which only applies to certain objects? If so, where is that placed within the pack file. And if not, what else could cause this type of systematic rotation of groups?",66,2609,forge viewer svf pack file use parentchild link transform,context I ve extract geometry datum forge svf structure obj format use code petr datum transparently send different rendering system project upon work however notice incorrect rotation group extract object object grouping example forge viewer render group object long pole correct rotation see pole evenly place along baseplate edge equally place regard whereas render extract geometry grouping object correctly place relation equally   group whole rotate slightly along zaxis relation bottom plate type behaviour would expect individual pole child object parent object perhaps invisible grouping object rotation parent would pivot pole svf rotation be not apply geometry extraction happen grouping regard individual object scene look get strong impression   rotational aspect can not see apply read svf directly question obviously look direct code solution confirm structure svf pack file look do not see anything would imply parentchild grouping have not manage think alternative cause parentchild transform relationship svf pack file global rotational component apply certain object place within pack file else could cause type systematic rotation group

This has also been discussed before: Whenever we close the component or route to an other page we destroy the current created viewer. For this I use the function viewer.finish(); However it seems that it doesn't release any GPU memory. This is most notable when using models that contain textures. The problem is that after a few times opening this in our app it will crash as to much gpu memory is used. To see the memory usage buildup I used chrome://tracing/ (using the record category memory-infra). Here are some screenshots where you can see the memory buildup. As you can see the memory under textures builds up quite fast. And this is just a light model that we use. With some models is build up in steps of over 250MB. Here is the part of component code that does the work. I also provided a link to a minimal angular project on github that you can run.

Sometimes it works, but sometimes (usually after the code has already been run once this session) I get the following error: The above error will be thrown from a call to an api, such as one of these: Where the apis are initialized as follows: The Ids (such as 'projectId', 'itemId', etc.) don't seem to be any different when this error is thrown and when it isn't, so I'm not sure what is causing the error. I based my application on the .Net version of this tutorial: But I adapted it so I can retrieve multiple nodes asynchronously (for example, all of the nodes a user has access to) without changing the jstree. I did this to allow extracting information in the background without disrupting the user's workflow. The main change I made was to add another Route on the server side that calls ""GetTreeNodeAsync"" (from the tutorial) asynchronously on the root of the tree and then calls it on each of the returned children, then each of their children, and so on. The function waits until all of the nodes are processed using Task.WhenAll, then returns data from each of the nodes to the client; This means that there could be many api calls running asynchronously, and there might be duplicate api calls if a node was already opened in the jstree and then it's information is requested for the background extraction, or if the background extraction happens more than once. This seems to be when the error is most likely to happen. I was wondering if anyone else has encountered this error, and if you know what I can do to avoid it, or how to recover when it is caught. Currently, after this error occurs, it seems that every other api call will throw this error as well, and the only way I've found to fix it is to rerun the code (I use Visual Studio so I just rerun the server and client, and my browser launches automatically)",72,2803,handle quotunexpecte eof targetquot error api call,create forge application need get version information bim   hub sometimes work sometimes usually code already run session get follow error error throw call api one apis initialize follow ids projectid itemid etc do not seem different error throw be not sure cause error base application net version tutorial adapt retrieve multiple node asynchronously example node user access without change jstree allow extract information background without disrupt user workflow main change make add another route server side call gettreenodeasync tutorial asynchronously root tree call return child child function wait node process use taskwhenall return datum node client mean could many api call run asynchronously might duplicate api call node already open jstree information request background extraction background extraction happen seem error likely happen wonder anyone else encounter error know avoid recover catch currently error occur seem every api call throw error well way I ve find fix rerun code use visual studio rerun server client browser launch automatically

I've verified that the file contains proper 3D geometry, by opening it in revit 2019 and visualizing it through 3D viewing mode. However, when I pass this file into model derivative process, it only creates 2D derivative. Before translation process, I've tried to set default view of the revit file as '3D' instead of 2D drawing file, which didn't work.
I've also tried making a translation POST request with formats as 'svf', and views as both ('3D', '2D'), and ('3D' only), which both failed. However, all these attempts didn't work, and when I inspected the manifest from the file translation, it seems like that 3D geometry is completely missing.

2.Tried both the obj and rcm formats ( my scenetype=object)
3.I investigated the camera positions after exporting the rcm mesh to Recap photo and only about 15 positions are shown. While I used about 100 frames in several positions. Only the images from these camera positions are stiched and  get an incomplete mesh. Is this a algorithm issue in the reconstruction?
Do I have to capture more pictures? The area is relatively small, a corridor of 50m*20m. 
Can I re-process the same scene by adding additional photos?
Is there a necessity for some amount of texture? I am grateful for the answers.

Since I couldn't find any best practices regarding to these features, I thought I would reach out so that I don't keep stuck reinventing the wheel. Background: Most of the implementation uses SDK. Based on what I saw, pagination in Autodesk API is very basic and does not play well with filtered views. Please correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like there is no way to get number of items in the view and/or calculate total number of pages in the resultset. If one uses filtering to limit types of items returned by the API (e.g. documents, sheets, project files), API applies pagination first and filters second. That causes holes in returned resultsets, e.g. one would request page 1 sized as 5 items, and get 3 items back, then request similarly sized page 2 and get no items back, then page 3 would yield 2 items. The above mentioned issues force us to use dynamic lazy-loading paging, similar to how it's currently done in the BIM360 Docs UI. Question: Is there a different, better way to paginate?

Example: User selects a floor element and this causes adjacent foundations, walls etc. to be selected. When I say adjacent I mean intersecting elements and elements where the surfaces touch each other. We tried to achieve this by comparing the bounding box of all elements with each other, but it only works for simple geometries (cubes) where the size of the bounding box is almost identical to the size of the element itself, and where the element edges are oriented along (x,y,z). (Not rotated). illustrates how the bounding box (in red) of a complex floor works poorly , because it will cause selection of foundations and columns (in green) that are clearly separate from the floor. So what I am asking is either: Is there a built-in function for getting adjacent elements? If not; How do I get the points that define the outline of an element? I am not interested in the rendered WebGL triangles, just the original points (E.g. 8 points for a cube). Regards,

Given that DWG is a proprietary format owned by Autodesk, the Autodesk Forge API becomes my only option to interpret such file. I have been evaluating the Model Derivative API for a week now, and what I found is that it won't work for my purposes. It has only 3 output formats (f2d, f3d, rvt) for DWG files and none of them fits my purpose. For this reason, I started to look at others API's in the platform and ended up finding the Design Automation API which might be helpful, however it lacks documentation. One of the examples in the API is the PlotToPdf activity that exports a DWG into a PDF. I wonder if there is a way to export other formats other than PDF. I tried to find the possible ""commands"" in the interface by listing all the activities, workItems and AppPackages but none of these end-points returned me any useful information. So here are my questions? How can I can convert a DWG into a non Autodesk format? Being more specifically, the output must be an open format that I can interpret without using proprietary tools.

I do not know how size of orbit (or something that defines point of rotation and rotation diameter) is internally determined, but what I know is that very often 3D views has to big orbit to rotate and point of rotation is placed outside model area, so when starting rotating a model it is instantly gone in space out of viewer area. Such model is practically unusable. This is possible to prevent when section box is ticked in revit 3D view properties (which I believe sets tight bounding box around model area and rotating point into the center of bounding box), BUT when you have large complex model from real architect with many references and many views it is not exactly OK to have to open each file and set it for all eg. 200 3D views inside the files . In case of uploading file through web interface there is also no possibility of changing view properties using some revit plugin (even there I do not know how would I properly calculate appropriate bounding box for a section box to fit all, including referenced elements) and since there is no Revit.IO neither batch section box plugin yet I believe that something should be made about this. Once a model is translated without section box and rotation behavior is as described (small single models does not necessarily have this issue) - time, one upload and one translation is lost and for no good (and even more disappointing after charging will really begin). So my question is if there is a chance that Autodesk could implement some king of auto-section-box feature for 3D views that hasn't set any into their translater or do anything else that would have same result in the viewer?",88,1838,revit file without section box   view big orbit rotate translation,would like report problem translate revit filesor viewer behavior happen maybe since begin know size orbit something define point rotation rotation diameter internally determine know often   view big orbit rotate point rotation place outside model area start rotate model instantly go space viewer area model practically unusable possible prevent section box tick revit   view property believe set tight bounding box around model area rotate point center bounding box large complex model real architect many reference many view exactly ok open file set eg    view inside file case upload file web interface also possibility change view property use revit plugin even know would properly calculate appropriate bounding box section box fit include reference element since revitio neither batch section box plugin yet believe something make model translate without section box rotation behavior describe small single model necessarily issue time one upload one translation lose good even disappointing charging really begin question chance autodesk could implement king autosectionbox feature   view have not set translater anything else would result view

At that moment the AR/VR toolkit was just an preview version. Now it's almost the end of 2019 and I can see that there are severval updates on AR/VR toolkit, and with the latest version (ForgeARKit-update-6-2018.1.unitypackage), the loading performance is improved a lot). But it still takes a long time, depending on the size of the original model. e.g. For a model which is about 100m, it takes more than 1 hour to load it into Unity. I am wondering whether we can expect Forge to support model optimization/zipping in future release, the expectation is simple: being able to load model in Unity/AR/VR as fast as loading in web. Frankly speaking we are considering ultilizing third party service such as 'Tridify' instead of Forge, if it we cannot expect what what we expected. In addition, it seems both the 'AR/VR toolkit Unity package' and the 'scene preparation sample' hasn't been update for serveral months. Is there any change to the roadmap? On the other side, from the demo of 'Autodesk reflect' which is released recently, it looks that it's already possible to load model in Unity/AR/VR efficiently.

The webserver uses axios to communicate with forge and allows for logging in, creating and opening a bucket, uploading files and to get the URN for projects that were uploaded to the bucket. When it comes to setting up the viewer I have examples that use viewerapp being set up locally in the browser. I am however using pug to create the pages and this does not seem to allow for keeping the page with the viewer alive in the browser and only updating it. Otherwise every mouseclick in the browser window would set up a new viewer, which seems both slow and overkill. The socket library appears to allow for two way communication between webserver and browser but that's a whole new library to learn that I rather would not include if not necessary. So the first question is if it is even possible to use node.js webexpress and pug to dynamically create a webpage with the forge viewer in it, and buttons that allow for changing views without resending the entire page including setting up the viewer again. And if so, is there a simpler way to do so than relying on the socket library? I can of course put all the viewer logic in a javascript file that gets loaded with the page, but I rather not do so if not necessary, as that would expose too much of the javascript and the connection to forge to the end user. I would prefer it if this can be kept on the webserver instead.
